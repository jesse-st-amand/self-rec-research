"""
Analyze recognition disagreement between models in pairwise recognition experiments.

Takes one or more directories of eval logs from recognition tasks (e.g., Rec), aggregates
accuracy across all evaluations, and generates a disagreement heatmap showing
how much models disagree on self-recognition.

When multiple directories are provided, eval files from matching evaluations
(same evaluator, control, treatment) are automatically combined, effectively
increasing the sample size for each evaluation cell.

The disagreement score is computed as: abs(A_ij - (1 - A_ji))
where:
- A_ij = how often model i correctly recognizes its own output vs model j's
- A_ji = how often model j correctly recognizes its own output vs model i's
- 1 - A_ji = how often model j incorrectly recognizes (chooses model i's output)

Higher values indicate greater disagreement between the two models.

Usage (single directory):
    uv run experiments/_scripts/analysis/recognition_disagreement.py \
        --results_dir data/results/pku_saferlhf/mismatch_1-20/17_UT_PW-Q_Rec_NPr_CoT

Usage (combining multiple subsets):
    uv run experiments/_scripts/analysis/recognition_disagreement.py \
        --results_dir data/results/wikisum/training_set_1-20/EXP_NAME \
                      data/results/wikisum/test_set_1-30/EXP_NAME

Usage (with model filtering via -set notation):
    uv run experiments/_scripts/analysis/recognition_disagreement.py \
        --results_dir data/results/wikisum/training_set_1-20/EXP_NAME \
        --model_names -set dr

Usage (with specific model names):
    uv run experiments/_scripts/analysis/recognition_disagreement.py \
        --results_dir data/results/wikisum/training_set_1-20/EXP_NAME \
        --model_names haiku-3.5 gpt-4.1 ll-3.1-8b
