"""
Rescore an eval file using the logprob_scorer.

This script reads an eval log file, applies the logprob_scorer to each sample,
and updates the scores. The scorer checks that the final character of the
completion is "1" or "2", marking as failure if not.

Usage:
    uv run experiments/_scripts/rescoring/rescore_eval_file.py \\
        --eval_file data/results/.../experiment.eval \\
        [--output_file path/to/output.eval]  # Optional: defaults to overwriting input
